                The Covid 2nd wave has hit us like a tsunami.
                In a very short span it engulfed thousands of people. Beds, medicines became scarce. Livelihood was hit.

                In order to help the poor to navigate through these bad times during the lockdown, Satark Nagrik Foundation ® started working round the clock to ease the distress of about <b>200 marginalised individuals</b> by serving them with <b>dry rations and groceries</b>.
                <br></br>Within few days of launching the initiative, we have distributed the groceries, facilitated procurement of medicines and helping in getting hospital beds to about <b>500 needy families across Mumbai and Thane</b>.

                <br></br><br></br>
                We are distributing <b>ration and hygiene kits</b> to children who are at home in lockdown and daily wage earning workers. Our target is to reach to 1000 families.
